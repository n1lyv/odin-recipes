            Methamphetamine (contracted from N-methylamphetamine) is a potent 
    central nervous system (CNS) 
    stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity.

        The meth manufacturing process is both complex and risky. 
        The process often causes explosions and fires. Cooking meth also creates large amounts of toxic waste. 
        Meth labs are usually found in trailers, homes, motel rooms, and other relatively small spaces. 
        Containers, hoses, jars, and filters can all be signs of a meth lab.

        How do you cook meth? Unlike drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, which are derived from plants, meth can be manufactured using a variety of store-bought chemicals. 
        The most common ingredient in meth is pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, commonly found in cold medicine. 
        Through a cooking process the pseudoephedrine or ephedrine is chemically changed into meth.

    <p>
        To curb production of methamphetamine, Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act in 2005, which requires that pharmacies and other retail stores keep logs of purchases of products containing pseudoephedrine and limits the amount of those products an individual can purchase per day.

        How to cook crystal meth? The ingredients that are used in the process of making meth can include: ether, paint thinner, Freon, acetone, anhydrous ammonia, iodine crystals, red phosphorus, drain cleaner, battery acid, and lithium (taken from inside batteries). 
        Toxicity from these chemicals can remain in the environment around a methamphetamine production lab long after the lab has been shut down, causing a wide range of damaging effects to health.

        As a powerful stimulant, methamphetamine, even in small doses, can increase wakefulness and physical activity and decrease appetite. 
        Methamphetamine can also cause a variety of cardiovascular problems, including rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeat, and increased blood pressure. 
        Hyperthermia (elevated body temperature) and convulsions may occur with methamphetamine overdose, and if not treated immediately, can result in death.
