            Energy consumption in three types of civilization as defined by Sagan's extended Kardashev scale
        </strong>
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <strong>Kardashev scale </strong> (Russian: Шкала Кардашева, romanized: Shkala Kardasheva) is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is able to use. The measure was proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964[1] and came to bear his name.

    <p>
        The scale is hypothetical, and regards energy consumption on a cosmic scale. Various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a wider range of power levels (types 0, IV to V) and the use of metrics other than pure power (e.g., computational growth or food consumption).

    <p>
        Kardashev first outlined his scale in a paper presented at the 1964 Byurakan conference, a scientific meeting that reviewed the Soviet radio astronomy space listening program. This paper, entitled "Передача информации внеземными цивилизациями" ("Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations"),[1] proposes a classification of civilizations into three types, based on the postulate of exponential progression:
