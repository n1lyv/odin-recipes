            Bhavachakra describing the cycle of saṃsāra: illustrated in the wheel are six realms of existence in which a sentient being can reincarnate, according to the rebirth doctrine of Buddhism. Yama, the god of death, is at the top of the outer rim. The outer rim shows the Twelve Nidānas doctrine.

    <p>
        Saṃsāra (Devanagari: संसार) is a Pali/Sanskrit word that means "wandering"[1][2] as well as "world," wherein the term connotes "cyclic change"[3] or "cyclicity of all life, matter, existence", a fundamental belief of most Indian religions.[4][5][6] When related to the theory of karma it is the cycle of death and rebirth,[1][4][7] also referred to with terms or phrases such as transmigration/reincarnation, karmic cycle, or Punarjanman, and "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence".

        The concept of saṃsāra has roots in the post-Vedic literature; the theory is not discussed in the Vedas themselves.[9][10] It appears in developed form, but without mechanistic details, in the early Upanishads.[4][11][12] The full exposition of the saṃsāra doctrine is found in Śramaṇic movements such as early Buddhism and Jainism, as well as various schools of Hindu philosophy after about the mid-1st millennium BCE.

    <p>
        The saṃsāra doctrine is tied to the karma theory of Hinduism, and the liberation from saṃsāra has been at the core of the spiritual quest of Indian traditions, as well as their internal disagreements.[4][14][15] The liberation from saṃsāra is called Moksha, Nirvāṇa, Mukti, or Kaivalya.
